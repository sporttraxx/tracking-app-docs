# Event enrollment

In order to enroll into an event you'll need an alphanumeric key that must have been provided to you by the event organizer. This key is unique and it is used to directly associate your smartphone to your role in the event.

## First use / not yet enrolled

1. You are presented two options: enroll by scanning a QR code or by manually entering your key.
