# SOS

The red SOS button allows you to send an SOS alarm to race control.

## Sending an SOS

1. Press and hold the red SOS button in the left side of the [main page](../main_interface).

   <div style={{ textAlign: "center", padding: 30 }}>
     <img src={sos_button} width={100} />
   </div>

2. A countdown will be displayed, keep holding the button.

<ScreenshotOSTabs page="alarms" img="timer-sos" width={300} />

3. You can either specify a reason for the SOS alarm or tap outside and go back to the main interface.

<ScreenshotOSTabs page="alarms" img="sos-choices" width={300} />

4. When your SOS message is received by race control, you'll receive an acknowledgment in your [Messages](../../chat).
