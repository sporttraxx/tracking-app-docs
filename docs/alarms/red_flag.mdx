# RED FLAG

The RED FLAG alarm is the only alarm that is sent to you by race control.

## Receiving a RED FLAG

Upon receiving a RED FLAG alarm, a red pop-up will be shown at the top of your screen. Dismiss it by pressing the _acknowledge_ button to let race control know you're aware of the situation.
