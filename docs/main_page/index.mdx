# Main page

This is the main page of the application.
:::caution Important
Tracky runs also in background mode. Just make sure not to close the app accidentally when putting it in background.
:::

<ScreenshotOSTabs page="main_page" img="map-active" width={300} />

## Start/stop tracking

In the bottom part of the screen there is a Play/Pause button, the most fundamental feature of the application
which allows you to start/stop the tracking activity.
:::caution Important
Only when tracking is active you'll be able to send and receive alarms and messages.
:::

## Navigation

At the very bottom there are 4 buttons to navigate through the different parts of the application and access different features:

<li style={{ listStyle: "none" }}>
  <div style={{ display: "flex", marginTop: 5, marginBottom: 5 }}>
    <img src={earth} width={24} style={{ marginRight: 5 }} />
    Map/HUD
  </div>
  <div style={{ display: "flex", marginTop: 5, marginBottom: 5 }}>
    <img src={chat} width={24} style={{ marginRight: 5 }} />
    Messages
  </div>
  <div style={{ display: "flex", marginTop: 5, marginBottom: 5 }}>
    <img src={phone} width={24} style={{ marginRight: 5 }} />
    Phone call
  </div>
  <div style={{ display: "flex", marginTop: 5, marginBottom: 5 }}>
    <img src={settings} width={24} style={{ marginRight: 5 }} />
    Settings
  </div>
</li>

## Map/HUD interface

This is the main part of the application. There are two possible views:

- [Map view](#map-view)
- [HUD view](#hud-view)

<div style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
  <span>
    By default, the HUD view is displayed. To switch between map and HUD, use
    the
  </span>{" "}
  <img src={earth} width={24} syle={{ left: 20 }} /> <span>button.</span>
</div>

:::caution Important
It is reccomended to display the HUD as opposed to the map when not necessary, since the continuous rendering and updating of the map requires more battery power than the HUD.
:::

### Map view

Very similar to any navigation application, the map interface allows you to follow your location on a map, to see the surrounding area and change the map's layer type.
Your current speed and the speed limit (if enabled) is shown in the top-left corner of the screen.

<ScreenshotOSTabs page="main_page" img="map-inactive" width={300} />

### HUD view

In the HUD view there is no map and it only shows some information about you, the current speed and the current time.

<ScreenshotOSTabs page="main_page" img="hud" width={300} />

## Messages

  <span>With the</span> <img src={chat} width={24} syle={{ left: 20 }} />{" "}

    {" "}
    button you can navigate to your chat with race control. A badge will be displayed
    whenever new messages are received.
  </span>
</div>

## Phone call

<div>
  <span>With the</span> <img src={phone} width={24} syle={{ left: 20 }} />{" "}
  <span>
    {" "}
    button you can directly call the emergency number (if provided by the event organizer)
    from within the app, instead of typing it in your phone's dialer.

</div>
