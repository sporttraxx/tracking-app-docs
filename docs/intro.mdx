Tracky allows you to use your smartphone as a tracking device connected to the Sporttraxx Tracking platform, exactly as the professional Sporttraxx trackers, with similar features and improved communication tools.

No matter if you're a competitor or a member of the staff, by enrolling in an event, you'll have access to different interfaces that allow you and the event organizer to track your movements along the stages and on the road sections.

Real-time messaging between you and the event organizer is also available, including [SOS](./alarms/sos), [OK](./alarms/ok) and [RED FLAG](./alarms/red_flag) alarms but also free text messages. In case of a staff member, points of interest can be sent to you from the organizer with specific instructions.
In addition, a quick phone call to the event emergency number can be initiated by a single button.
